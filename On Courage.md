# On courage

## The Where
In the house I grew up in, we had a tiny balcony. When I was a teenager, I used to sit there for hours. It was a sight less awkward for my mom to see than a kid sitting, looking at the wall with headphones on.

Anyway, across the street, there was a car trade shop. It was nothing like American open-plan shops with greasy tight suits. It consisted of two garages with sketchy 90s Peugeots there. The type of cars that are imported in two halves, as a governmental measure to ensure that they are used for parts. But, under the supervision of a small, slender man with a thin, razor-like mustache sitting on a miserable plastic armchair in front of the garages, they were put together and sold as fully functioning cars.

Don't get the wrong idea that our main man of the story can be summed up as an outlaw. He is too generous to let you go home with just that. Despite spending a few years in jail for flipping cars meant for parts into fully safe vehicles, Uncle Sugar has had the best for our little community in mind.

In our little town, everybody was made out of the same old and mostly miserable cloth, but in our little street, we took a lot of pride. This pride has led Uncle Sugar to personally supervise a mob initiative to construct a speed bump perpendicular and intersecting right between his two garages and his legs if he is seated in his favorite spot.

## The Others

I tend to hold people accountable for their actions. However, I have a special sympathy repository for my small towners, for I know how the town whipped everybody with boredom, and we’re not made for that.

Despite my sympathy, me, Uncle Sugar, and everyone in our street hated the kids who would drive old Ladas. Not for any grudge we hold against communism or what this car represents, but for the loud exhaust and louder music that thundered out of the brothel-looking lights of wanna-be cool wank stains.

Before our righteous mob constructed the speed bump, these kids used to race the length of our phallus-looking bent street, scaring the birds. I also wondered what line of thought they disrupted in Uncle Sugar's mind while he shifted in his seat, burning his cigarette through the dust of the speeding Lada.

The next day after the speed bump was constructed, I witnessed Uncle Sugar providing a full description of the vaginal canal of the mother of a kid in a Lada. The kid wasn’t impressed or didn’t agree with the tone, so he started describing back certain details of Uncle Sugar's late mother's body and sped away, scaring the birds.

After this interaction, I got used to the sight of Uncle Sugar smashing the windshields of the rouge Ladas with a heavy-enough wooden stick. I never saw it around; it always came out of nowhere.

## The Question
What is courage? Is it a problem to not know? Should I be ashamed? I thought there was nothing such as a stupid question. Do I look that high? I hope not. Where does he hide the wooden stick?

Well, in the midst of a storm of such questions, your attention is only captured by big gestures, epic ones. As a timid kid, courage was hypothetically the answer to my question. The question that filled me up to a point that if it was ever answered, that would be it for me, and I would cease to exist.

Hence, I looked everywhere.

## The Conflict

Usually, after windshields are smashed, the kids come back with their fathers, or uncles, or any fighting-age male relatives. It didn’t matter because Uncle Sugar always won before the fight ever began.

The kid’s group would make it to the scene, descend the car, walk towards Uncle Sugar's throne, silence before the storm, then Uncle Sugar would take off his clothes, strip naked, like the moment he was born, and start running towards them.

Now, imagine yourself on your way to avenge your Lada. You’re a man, you’re angry, you have two other friends on each side. But in 5-6 seconds, a 50-something-year-old man, stark naked, is running towards you. His swinging circumcised member doesn't numb but amplifies the question, “What will he do once he makes it here?”

Right there, right then, you have lost. The moment you doubt, you lose. Don’t let your mind drift away; you still have fight or flight to do. So, you decide to fly, leaving behind your friends, the uncertain, and the Lada.

## The Wrong Answer
Being that kind of a kid, I couldn’t but search this scene for the existence of courage or lack thereof. It was one of these times to put the ice skaters on and slide on the slippery surface of subjectivity and logic, where it doesn’t matter where to slide as long as you don’t smash your face.

Does courage mean having no reservations, no doubts? now it’s time Uncle Sugar’s stark ass didn’t seem so contemplative to me. It’s the ones that thought who lost. But how to up-root fear? I don’t know. Do I look that high?
